# Fill this file with your product scope

Typically the easy way is to go have a chat with an LLM and explain your idea.

Some things to consider:
1. The repo expects your product scope to be structured as a series of features, each with a test acceptance criteria.
2. Frontend features can be tested with live browser testing.
3. Backend features can be tested with unit tests.
4. If you scope it right you don't have to do anything and the composer will do everything for you :)
