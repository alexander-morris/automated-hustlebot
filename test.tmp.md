# ClickBot Testing Instructions

1. Open Cursor UI where the target button appears
2. Make sure the target button is visible on screen
3. The bot should automatically:
   - Detect the button with high confidence (>0.9)
   - Verify structural similarity (>0.8)
   - Click the button if all criteria are met

## Monitoring
- Check logs in `clickbot_v4/temp/logs/clickbot.log`
- Bot runs every 1 second, with 2-second cooldown between clicks
- Move mouse to screen corner to abort (failsafe)

## Current Status
- Bot is running and monitoring screen
- Target image size: 46x106 pixels
- Using optimized image matching with text feature analysis
- CPU usage has been optimized with proper delays
