# Autonomous Development Process

## Feature Implementation Flow

1. **Feature Selection**
   - System reads from knowledge-base/features/
   - Selects next unimplemented feature
   - Creates implementation plan

2. **Test Creation**
   - Generates test cases based on feature requirements
   - Creates both frontend and backend tests as needed
   - Adds to appropriate test suites

3. **Implementation**
   - Writes minimal code to implement feature
   - Follows TDD approach
   - Commits changes automatically

4. **Testing**
   - Runs full test suite
   - Identifies any failures
   - Logs all test results

5. **Error Resolution**
   - Identifies single error to fix
   - Implements fix
   - Reruns tests
   - Repeats until all tests pass

## Error Handling Protocol

1. **Error Detection**
   - Monitor logs for errors
   - Parse error messages
   - Identify error type and location

2. **Isolation**
   - Focus on single error
   - Create minimal reproduction
   - Document error context

3. **Resolution**
   - Implement fix
   - Verify fix doesn't introduce new errors
   - Update documentation

4. **Verification**
   - Run full test suite
   - Confirm error is resolved
   - Log resolution details

## Autonomous Operation Rules

1. **No Manual Intervention**
   - System operates without human approval
   - Automatic commit and push
   - Self-monitoring and recovery

2. **Single Error Focus**
   - Only one error fixed at a time
   - Complete system restart after each fix
   - Comprehensive testing after each change

3. **Logging Requirements**
   - All actions must be logged
   - Error states documented
   - Resolution steps recorded

4. **Feature Progress**
   - Track feature implementation status
   - Document completed features
   - Update roadmap automatically
