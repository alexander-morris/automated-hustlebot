# Automated Development Process Overview

## Core Concept
This repository demonstrates a fully automated development workflow where Cursor/Claude operates autonomously to develop, test, and maintain a full-stack application. The system is designed to operate without requiring manual acceptance of changes or manual code execution.

## Key Principles
1. Autonomous Operation - No human intervention required
2. Single Error Focus - Debug and fix one error at a time
3. Continuous Testing - All changes trigger relevant test suites
4. Comprehensive Logging - All actions and outcomes are logged
5. Feature-Driven Development - Features are implemented from knowledge-base specifications
